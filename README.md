Zen: A Meditation Experience for the Human and Plant Species

A meditation interface co-created by humans and plants — blending biofeedback, mindfulness, and digital design.

Overview

Zen is an interactive meditation experience that bridges the natural and digital worlds through plant-human biofeedback.
Developed for Eco-Centric Design: Interspecies Co-Creation (Professor Jiabao Li, Spring 2025), the project explores how technology can foster empathy and mindfulness across species.

The app translates real-time signals from plants into responsive visual and auditory feedback, allowing both plants and humans to meditate together through a shared interface.
